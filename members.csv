She has one brother. Dawn attended St Bernadette’s Catholic Secondary School and studied to GCSE level. After leaving school, she attended Soundwell Technical College where she gained qualifications in secretarial, business studies and law. She later qualified for the Institute of Leadership and Management Diploma through study with the TUC. In 1989, Dawn moved to south Wales where her two sons were born, educated, brought up and still live and work. She has been married to Martin since 2011.","Dawn’s first job after leaving college was as secretary to the Regional Managing Director of Guest Keen and Nettlefold Distributors in Bristol. She moved from there to work as a medical secretary in the NHS before spending a brief period of time working as a Local Government officer. It was during these years of employment in the public sector that Dawn became actively involved with her trade union NALGO (later to become UNISON). At the age of just 23, Dawn was appointed as a full-time Branch Organiser for NALGO working with the union’s NHS membership in Bristol. In 1989, she moved to south Wales to become the youngest and first female District Officer in the area. She rose through the ranks of her union to become the UNISON Cymru/Wales Head of Health, a position she held up to her election as Assembly Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney in May 2016. She counts amongst her proudest achievements leading on the negotiations that delivered the Living Wage into NHS Wales in 2014. In her union roles, Dawn was an advocate, negotiator, public speaker and campaigner for members working primarily in the public sector services of Local Government, Health, and Higher and Further Education, as well as the privatised utilities of gas, water and electricity and the voluntary sector.

Dawn worked with a number of organisations representing her union, including the NHS Wales Partnership Forum, Local Government NJC for Wales and the Welsh Government Workforce Partnership Council. She regularly attended and spoke at the Wales TUC and Welsh Labour Party Conferences as a UNISON delegate.","Dawn joined the Labour Party in l983. She is also a member of the Socialist Health Association and a member of the Public Services union, UNISON. Her political views were shaped by her upbringing and by parents who were both trade unionists and Labour Party members. During the miners’ strike of l984-85, Dawn worked with the South West TUC to collect both money and food to support the south Wales miners. It was the miners’ strike and other industrial unrest during the 1980sthat drove her into politics. She joined CND in l984 and in April l986 won a by-election in the then Conservative-held ward of Staple Hill to become a Labour Councillor in Kingswood District Council at the age of just 26. Dawn served on the Policy, Housing, Personnel (Shadow Chair), Environmental Health and Planning Committees.
